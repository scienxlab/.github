**scien✖️lab** is a microscopic scientific laboratory producing open scientific software. It includes some projects migrated out of [Agile Scientific](https://code.agilescientific.com) when it closed in 2022.

## ⚒️ &nbsp; Open tools for scientists & data scientists

You can install these with `pip`, or clone the repo:

- [`redflag`](https://github.com/scienxlab/redflag) &mdash; automatic safety net for machine learning datasets.
- [`checklists`](https://github.com/scienxlab/checklists) &mdash; simple checklists for high quality data science.
- [`unmap`](https://github.com/scienxlab/unmap) &mdash; a small utility for ripping data from pseudocolour images.

We also maintain a set of programming challenges called 'kata', aimed at geoscientists:

- [`kata`](https://kata.geosci.ai) &mdash; programming challenges for earth scientists learning to program.

If you'd like to get involved in any of these projects, or collaborate on new ones, dive into the repos or [get in touch](mailto:hello@scienxlab.org).
